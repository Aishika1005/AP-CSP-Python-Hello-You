# Python: Hello You!
This first Python program introduces you to the idea of computer program. It also fulfills the tradition of writing your first computer program, which is to output "Hello, World!" to the screen.

We will take this program a step further to ask the user for their name, and greet them!

The lesson is set up as a code-along, so you will need your instructor to walk you through the process.
